# CS30 Major Porject

## Description
I am building Happy connect - in a grid there are some number of pair of dots with the same colour and you have to conncet them by dragging such that fills out the grid without disturbing the path of the other dots within a time limit.


## Need to have list

- Collision detection 
- Scoring system
- Start/restart/game over screens
- interative controls (tap/click/arrow keys)
- Basic animations (character jump, block fall)
- Timers
- Sound effect/background music
- Game rules implementation
- Display interfaces (score, lives, timer)
- Win lose detection
- Basic instructions/tutorial on how to play
- Navigation buttons

## Nice to have list

- Random easter egg sound effects 
- Difficulty levels
- Leaderboard high score storing
- Animated transitions or effects (eg. screen shake)
- Coins system - play any game and add coins to the same vault and use it to buy special items
- Customizable player name or avatar
- Saving game progress 
- Achievements or badges
- Funny losing animations
- Custom controls for games which are savable

- IF TIME ALLOWS
- Go Up  - the sprite moves upward in a vertical pathfrom a point to another, you have click and hold the mouse and drag  it to determine the speed and the angle of the sprite. there are obstackles on the way. You have to keep climbing up and hit a highscore.
- Cake tower - there is going to be a slab of cake moving horizontatlly and you have to place the cake slab right on top of previous the cake slab, if the cake slab is not angled properly (ei, previous cake slab domain [0, 4] and the new cake slab domain [1, 5]) the part thats not on top of the previous cake slab falls out. You have to keep climbing up and hit a highscore.
- Memory game - there are some cards in the screen and for one turn you click on two cards, if there two cards are the same, those two fade away and you have to finish pairing uo all the cards within a time limit to win the game.
- character design choosing
- Camera following/world scroll (eg. when moving upwards in go up)
