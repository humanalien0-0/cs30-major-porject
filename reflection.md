# CS30 Major Porject Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?

- Spend less time perfectioning visuals and complete the basic logic first.
- Be more productive in the start rather than the end.
- Study more about 2dCollide library.

## Was everything in needs to have completed?

- Yes, almost everything in the needs to have was completed exept the sound effects which i didnt have much to complete.

## The hardest part?

- Moment restrictions of the line was the hardest puzzle to solve.
- Giving different characteristics to the special blocks was also quite challenging.

## Were there any problems I could not solve?

- I was asked to make the movement of the line smoother which I was unable to do because the code was based on drawing the line from cell to cell rather than a line from a pencil. I coudnt think of a way to make it smoother without disrupting the fundamentals.
